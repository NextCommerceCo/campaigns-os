# Build Packet

The Build Packet is the campaign assembly handoff. It wraps, but does not replace, the CampaignSpec.

It answers:

- Which CampaignSpec and Map ID are we building?
- Which public route slug and campaign directory are expected?
- Where are the prepared HTML/assets?
- Which target page-kit repo should be updated?
- Which starter template family is locked?
- Which commerce catalog/contract should the agent read?
- Which deploy target and QA policy apply?

The current schema is `schemas/campaign-runtime-build-packet.v0.schema.json`.

Page-kit also needs `campaign.store_url` for `_data/campaigns.json`. Additional Store Profile fields live under `campaign.store_*` as optional storefront/legal metadata because they are operator-entered, not Campaigns API data.

## Artifact Locations

By default `campaigns-os start` writes into the target repo:

```text
campaign-runtime.build.json
.campaign-runtime/build-context.json
.campaign-runtime/assembly-report.json
.campaign-runtime/doctor-output.json
```

Commit durable packet/context/report artifacts when they represent a real build handoff. The Campaigns API key is a public, browser-side, domain-allowlisted key and may already be present in the local CampaignSpec as `campaign.campaigns_api_key`; do not duplicate it into the packet unless the spec is unavailable. Do not commit raw private API responses, backend secrets, or temporary media exports.

`campaigns-os start` writes packet, context, and report paths relative to the target repo when possible. If your source HTML or spec lives outside the target repo, move durable inputs into the repo before committing the handoff so future agents do not inherit machine-local paths.
