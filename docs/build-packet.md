# Build Packet

The Build Packet is the campaign assembly handoff. It wraps, but does not replace, the CampaignSpec.

It answers:

- Which CampaignSpec and Map ID are we building?
- Which public route slug and campaign directory are expected?
- Where are the prepared HTML/assets?
- Which target page-kit repo should be updated?
- Which starter template family is locked?
- Which commerce catalog/contract should the agent read?
- Which deploy target and QA policy apply?

The current schema is `schemas/campaign-runtime-build-packet.v0.schema.json`.

Page-kit also needs `campaign.store_url` for `_data/campaigns.json`. Additional Store Profile fields live under `campaign.store_*` as optional storefront/legal metadata because they are operator-entered, not Campaigns API data.

## Artifact Locations

By default `campaigns-os start` writes into the target repo:

```text
campaign-runtime.build.json
.campaign-runtime/build-context.json
.campaign-runtime/assembly-report.json
.campaign-runtime/doctor-output.json
```

Commit durable packet/context/report artifacts when they represent a real build handoff. The Campaigns API key is a public, browser-side, domain-allowlisted key and may already be present in the local CampaignSpec as `campaign.campaigns_api_key`; do not duplicate it into the packet unless the spec is unavailable. Do not commit raw private API responses, backend secrets, or temporary media exports.

`campaigns-os start` / `campaigns-os prepare-build` writes packet, context, report, and generated doctor-output paths as relative paths by default, including sibling CampaignSpec/source directories such as `../campaign-source`. `campaigns-os doctor` and `validate-build-packet` continue to accept older absolute-path packets; use `campaigns-os doctor --strip-paths` when regenerating a commit-ready doctor output from an older packet. Committed handoff artifacts should not contain machine-local absolute paths unless no relative form is possible.

## CampaignSpec Retrieval (`--map-id`)

`campaigns-os start` / `campaigns-os prepare-build` accept the CampaignSpec via either of two routes:

| Flag | Source | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--spec <path>` | Local JSON file | Offline work, CI runs against a fixture, or hand-edited spec drafts |
| `--map-id <id>` | Map Builder proxy (KV-backed) | Default agentic flow — KV is the source of truth, no file shuttling |

When `--map-id <id>` is set, the CLI fetches `GET <proxy>/api/spec/<id>` (default `<proxy>` is `https://campaign-map.nextcommerce.com`) and caches the response to `<target>/.campaign-runtime/fetched-specs/<id>.json`. The cached file is what downstream stages read, so the packet's `spec.local_path` always resolves to an on-disk artifact regardless of intake mode.

Retrieval behavior:

- **Re-fetch by default.** Every `start` / `prepare-build` invocation re-fetches from KV. KV is the source of truth; the cache file is a debug/inspection artifact, not a performance optimization.
- **`--cached-spec`** reuses the cache without a network call. Use for offline iteration or when the proxy is temporarily unreachable.
- **`--proxy-base <url>`** overrides the default origin. Use for staging environments or local Worker dev (`wrangler dev`).
- Failure modes (HTTP error, `{ok: false}` response, network timeout) surface as clean CLI errors before any packet is written.

The fetched spec is treated identically to a `--spec`-supplied local file from this point forward — same identity validation, same `prepareBuild` pipeline, same idempotency semantics. Re-running `start --map-id` on the same campaign re-fetches the spec, regenerates the packet, and re-runs doctor. If `design_source` was newly populated since the last run, the doctor's design_source-aware blocker logic surfaces it; if nothing changed, the run is a no-op as far as downstream stages are concerned.
